# Deployment

Pupate goes live in two steps around one IMD launch. The hook takes Cocoon and the timelock as
constructor arguments, so both exist before the launch; the token and the pool exist only after it,
so wiring and vesting come after. Rehearse the whole sequence on Sepolia first (Plan 4).

## 0. Before anything

- A wallet with ETH for gas and at least a few IMD for paid IMD actions (0.5 IMD each).
- `MAINNET_RPC_URL` for the fork test: `forge test --match-contract CocoonSeaportForkTest` must pass.
- The addresses for the launch chain: PoolManager, Seaport 1.6, the collection, the IMD token, IMD's
  oracle attester (`GET https://api.imd.fun/oracle/requests` returns it as `attester`).

## 1. Pre-launch contracts

    forge script script/DeployPreLaunch.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC --broadcast --verify

Deploys, in order: `TimelockController` (48 hours; the developer proposes, anyone executes, no admin),
`FloorFeed` (owned by the deployer for now), `Cocoon` (owned by the deployer for now). Prints the
`constructorArgs` line for `launch.json`.

Then make the first oracle request through IMD's paid-action flow with FloorFeed as the consumer:
`consumer.verifyingContract` = the FloorFeed address in lowercase, `consumer.chainId` = the launch chain,
`chainId` = the evidence chain (mainnet), the floor question in `keeper/questions/floor.question.txt`
(`keeper/lib/oracle.mjs::floorQuoteInput` builds the body). The oracle request's record carries
`questionHash`; keep it, and keep the attestation for the first report.

## 2. The launch

Fill `<COCOON_ADDRESS>` and `<TIMELOCK_ADDRESS>` in `launch.json`, commit, and pay for a
`launch.open` of kind `univ4_hook` pointing at this repository and that commit (`repoUrl`,
`baseCommit`, `pairWith: "eth"`, pool share 85%). The swarm reviews, deploys the token and the hook,
opens and seeds the pool in one transaction, and reports the addresses on `GET /launches/:id`.

Check before going on: the hook's `sink()` is Cocoon, its `owner()` is the timelock, its
`launchPool()` is the intended pool, and `openedAtBlock()` is the deployment block.

## 3. Post-launch

    COCOON=… FEED=… TIMELOCK=… TOKEN=… HOOK=… DEVELOPER=… QUESTION_HASH=… \
    forge script script/PostLaunch.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC --broadcast --verify

Wires Cocoon to the launch pool (it refuses any pool whose hook does not name it as the sink), deploys
`PupateVesting` and moves the developer's allocation into it, pins the oracle question, and hands
FloorFeed and Cocoon to the timelock. From here on every parameter change goes through the 48-hour
timelock.

## 4. First report, keeper, site

- Submit the first floor report (`FloorFeed.report`). The first report after the question is set is
  not rate-limited.
- Start the keeper: `node keeper/bin/keeper.mjs --loop` (env in `keeper/README.md`; `--once` for cron,
  `--status` to look). It reports every six hours, flushes, buys from Seaport listings at or under the
  tolerance, settles filled listings, burns and starts the auctions. `node keeper/test/fork.mjs` runs the
  whole cycle on the local fork. Two things to expect: at the opening pool depth one `burn()` spends only
  about 0.2 ETH (the 5% impact limit), so a large burn pot takes many calls five blocks apart; and the
  burn reward only covers gas below roughly 9 gwei at that depth, so third-party callers will burn only
  when it pays and the project's keeper burns regardless, up to `GAS_PRICE_CAP_GWEI`.
- Publish the site and point `pupate.fun` at it. `deploy/` sets up one small VPS that serves the export
  over HTTPS and runs the keeper beside it, with `status.json`, `listings.json` and `work.json` written
  straight into the web root; the export is plain files, so any static host (IPFS included) works too.
- Pair the first seat: the operator calls `Cocoon.authorizeWorker` with IMD's pairing message, then
  completes the pairing on IMD with any signature bytes.

## What each party holds afterwards

| Party | Can do | Cannot do |
|---|---|---|
| Timelock (developer proposes, 48 h) | lower the tax; change Cocoon's bounded parameters, the operator, FloorFeed's attester, question and freshness | raise the tax; move ETH, seats or tokens; change the sink, the split, the launch schedule, the liquidity gate |
| Developer | claim the developer balance; change the developer address; release vested PUPATE | anything else |
| Operator | approve and revoke IMD pairings for held seats | move anything; sign anything else |
| Anyone | flush, buy, settle, adopt, burn, run the auctions, release vesting, execute matured timelock operations | |

## The launch request (IMD policy v34, 2026-10-07)

- The pool's LP fee tier must be **12500** (1.25%), tick spacing 60. The ETH-paired opening valuation is fixed by policy at 10 ETH on mainnet (20 ETH on Sepolia), up to 100 ETH.
- A `launch.open` for a self-hosted repository carries `shape: "chain"`. Pupate's steps are `audit-imported-code → adversarial-review`: IMD plans an audit of the code as it is, the manifest, four specialist audits, a judge and the deployment, and the only node with a write path is the manifest node (`launch.json`), so no agent can change `src/` or `test/`. Launch #1205 was admitted in this shape. An `adapt-contract-project` step between the two would give an agent a write budget over the source, which Pupate cannot use: the hook is bound to a Cocoon that is already deployed. Ready bodies: `keeper/questions/launch.check.json` (mainnet) and `launch.sepolia.check.json`. Run `node keeper/bin/imd.mjs check launch.open <body>` first: it is free and must return no blockers. `script/mainnet/launch.mjs manifest` sets `repoUrl` and `baseCommit`.
- Admission runs seven checks, visible on the launch record (`GET /launches/:id`, `admissionChecks`): `provenance`, `findings` (the judge's blocking findings must all be resolved), `independent_review`, `bytecode` (every contract under `src/` reproducible, and free of `CALLCODE`, `DELEGATECALL` and `SELFDESTRUCT`), `manifest`, `protected_invariants` (seven tests against the creation code) and `economics`. IMD builds with forge 1.8.3; run the suite on that version before paying.
- IMD pays the launch transaction up to `gasCeilingWei` = 0.05 ETH on mainnet. Measured on the local mainnet fork (`script/local/`): token deploy 415,644 gas, hook deploy through the CREATE2 factory 1,390,744, pool open + single-sided seed in one transaction 289,486, about 2.1M in all before IMD's own factory overhead. At 2.1M the ceiling holds up to ~24 gwei; budget for 3.5M (~14 gwei) to be safe, and launch while the base fee is well under that.
- Rehearse locally first: `node script/local/up.mjs` deploys the whole stack on an anvil fork of mainnet and `cd site && npx --yes tsx scripts/fork-e2e.ts` exercises the site's live modules against it (buy and sell through the Universal Router, flush).

## Mainnet, in progress (2026-10-10)

`script/mainnet/launch.mjs pre` ran on 2026-10-10 from the deployer `0x7A2B112aF54419ed0B18e051027f3142C13441D9`
(also `DEVELOPER` and `OPERATOR`), base fee 0.063 gwei:

| Contract | Address | |
|---|---|---|
| TimelockController | `0x8bE826082c0FbAeC485048aA26ef42aC147898EC` | 48 hours, the developer proposes |
| FloorFeed | `0x5A215aa9883cEfE5fa74085ba66288388b83700C` | attester `0x5598Aa91…2982`, evidence chain 1; owned by the deployer until `post` |
| Cocoon | `0xc4E514E60565a2c04bd657f18bB34B503D6c299D` | the corrected vault, deployed by `redeploy`; owned by the deployer until `post` |
| Cocoon, retired | `0x0adD7b9584cd73CeF21B39014e3ff6077BE53441` | the vault of launch #1400: never wired, empty, abandoned (see below) |

From block 26161806.

`question` ran on 2026-10-12. The wallet approved Permit2 for IMD
(`0x74667fc1ef6042085f7ca5cfc37371a986d728caabba8eb08480e1e389f21165`) and paid 0.5 IMD for the floor
question (order `ce7d267d-cc49-4905-86b8-a4a1a28a86cb`, payment
`0x6293f038829467a2c36690c43bbc7058ac3ab8bf182ec1645f8f31e74ba469f2`). Oracle request
`db921753-2067-4094-8547-649f63a72179` was attested in under two minutes: twelve of the twenty seats
answered, all twelve with 2.68 ETH read from OpenSea, against a quorum of eleven.

The runner's progress file carries the same addresses and ids.

Before the first payment the free checks changed three things, recorded in spec revision 7 and
`docs/phase0-findings.md`: the hook's liquidity gate is the opening transaction (the hook is not deployed
yet, so only its source changed; Cocoon and FloorFeed above are as deployed), the floor question asks a
panel for the collection's lowest listing instead of a chain recipe for a median of sales, and the paid
path of the IMD client was corrected and dry-run to its last free step. One more thing surfaced at the
first payment itself: this machine's clock ran 13 seconds fast, which put the permit's deadline past the
window IMD allows (`invalid_payment_window`, nothing charged); the client now takes the time from IMD's
own answers.

Before the second payment an independent review of the gate change came back with nothing blocking
(`docs/REVIEW.md`): one regression test and one fork test through IMD's real factory were added, the
gate's one residual is stated in `launch.json` and in the request, and the request took the two-step
shape above.

### Launch #1400, parked (2026-10-12)

`open` paid 0.5 IMD (order `ef7a9245-2bc9-4a65-ae99-e91bf9514aef`, payment
`0x526a5c3e4802548392e578157cb0871fcb4df139fd567bdcb839f84eac4c4f2d`) and IMD's swarm worked on job
`f3f01060-a9cd-4c35-bad7-e54ac763a342` for 53 minutes. Six of the seven admission checks passed. The
seventh, findings, did not: the audit found that `Cocoon.skim()` could be called from inside
`takeAuction`'s lot transfer and book a taker's unrefunded excess into the burn pot. The launch was
parked as #1400 and nothing was deployed. The audit's text is on
`https://explorer.imd.fun/jobs/f3f01060-a9cd-4c35-bad7-e54ac763a342`, and `docs/REVIEW.md` records every
finding with its outcome.

The vault is fixed in the source and deployed again. `script/mainnet/launch.mjs redeploy` deploys the
new Cocoon beside the same FloorFeed and timelock, at the launch wallet's next contract address
(`0xc4E514E60565a2c04bd657f18bB34B503D6c299D`, nonce 4), which `launch.json`, the launch request and the fork test already name; the step
sends nothing if the wallet's nonce has moved. The question hash and the first attestation are FloorFeed's
and stay as they are. Then: `manifest`, `open` (0.5 IMD), `post`, `report`, `finish`.

What that attempt taught about IMD:

- Half of each payment came back within minutes: 0.25 IMD from `0xd60483eb…9b21` after the oracle
  request and again after the launch order, so each action has cost 0.25 IMD net so far.
- The swarm needed 53 minutes from payment to verdict: 11 for the first audit, 7 for the manifest, about
  12 for the four specialists side by side, then the judge, one revision of the manifest, and the judge
  again.
- `launch.json`'s notes may be 4,000 characters at most, and a request whose objective makes a node's
  rendered assignment longer than 8,000 characters is refused by the free check (`objective_too_large`).
  An objective of about 4,500 characters fits.
- IMD's manifest agent is told by its own reference text to write `initialPrice` as 2^96; say in the
  request that the value in the manifest is to be kept.
- The wait in `open` must outlast a sleeping laptop: the runner now waits out network errors, and finds
  Foundry where `foundryup` puts it when the shell's PATH does not have it.

## What the Sepolia rehearsal taught (2026-10-10)

`script/sepolia/up.mjs` ran the whole sequence on Sepolia with the real deployer wallet (addresses in
`keeper/addresses.sepolia.json`; all post-deploy checks pass). Four things to carry to mainnet:

- **Gas limits need a margin over forge's estimate.** Forge simulates on the project's `cancun` EVM;
  live networks run newer schedules. On Sepolia contract creation cost about seven times the estimate
  (Cocoon 38.4M gas against 5.5M on mainnet), so the rehearsal runs `--gas-estimate-multiplier 900`.
  Mainnet's `eth_estimateGas` agrees with forge (Cocoon 5.5M), so `130` is enough there. Unused gas is
  refunded; an underestimate costs the whole limit.
- **Do not take gas limits from the node per transaction (`--skip-simulation`).** The provider's nodes
  lag each other by a block or two; the second transaction's estimate then runs against a state that
  does not have the first, and forge gives up on the nonce. Keep the simulation, send with `--slow
  --retries 10 --delay 8`, and wait for the state to settle (three agreeing polls) between scripts.
- **`PostLaunch` is idempotent.** It skips the wiring, the question and the ownership transfers the
  chain already shows, and `VESTING` reuses a vesting contract an interrupted attempt deployed. A run
  that stops halfway is simply run again.
- **Free RPC tiers cap `eth_getLogs` ranges** (Alchemy: 10 blocks). The keeper and the site halve their
  log chunk when a node refuses a range and keep the size that worked, so a fresh keeper can still
  catch up from the pre-launch block.
